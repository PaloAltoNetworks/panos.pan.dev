## Support

This template/solution is released under an as-is, best effort, support
policy. These scripts should be seen as community supported and Palo
Alto Networks will contribute our expertise as and when possible. We do
not provide technical support or help in using or troubleshooting the
components of the project through our normal support options such as
Palo Alto Networks support teams, or ASC (Authorized Support Centers)
partners and backline support options. The underlying product used (the
VM-Series firewall) by the scripts or templates are still supported, but
the support is only for the product functionality and not for help in
deploying or using the template or script itself.
