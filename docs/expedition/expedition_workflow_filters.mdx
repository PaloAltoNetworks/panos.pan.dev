In this section we present a workflow example to create a set of filters with one goal in mind.
During the development of this section, we will learn on the usage of `predefined filters`, `simple filters`, 
`complex filters` and `combination filters`; as well on the task related to their creation, monitoring on their execution state and collection of filtered results.

### Preamble A. Filter characteristics

Expedition 2 allows creating filters on the different objects that a configuration contains. 
restrict the target of actions, specifying the objects that should appear in reports, identifying objects
that should be deleted, etc. 
One filters may be desirable for multiple goals, therefore, the filters have been designed for 
sharing and reuse.

As main characteristics, we can state that filters are  
- **named**, so we can identify them and refer to them
- **executed in background**, as tasks that can be monitored and are non-blocking
- **stored**, so we can get back to the results of a filter at any given point
- **reusable**, in order to combine them in other filters
- **exportable** between projects and between Expeditions, to be shared in the community or applied to multiple projects in an easy manner

### Preamble B. Filters Types

| Filter Type              | Description                                                                               | Example                  |  
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
|    Predefined            | Predefined filters. This do not require parameters as the logic is intrinsic to the filter| <small>`fi1`: [address] is ipv4 </small>            |  
|    Simple                | Filters that specify                                                                      | <small>`fi2`: [address,addressGroup] name contains 'DNS'           </small>      |
|    Combination           | Filters that use other filters' results to evaluate the filter logic                      | <small>`fi3`: [securityRule] source contains filter `'fi2'`        </small>      |
|    Operation             | Filters that perform boolean logic operations on other defined filters                    | <small>`fi4`: (filter `'fi1'` and filter `'fi2'`) or filter `'fi3'`</small>                  |
