- description: Field to get items on subsequent pages. For example, if your first request is pagelength = 100, you will get the first 100 vulnerabilities (indexed from 0 to 99). To get the next 100, add offset = 100 to your second request. This skips the first 100 vulnerabilities and gets the next 100 starting from index number 100.

- description: Optional but recommended field specifying the number of items for each page. The default page length for vulnerabilities is unlimited and the maximum is 1000.  Setting a shorter length improves response times. The following value is an integer.
