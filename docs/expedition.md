# What is Expedition?

**Expedition** is the fifth evolution of the Palo Alto Networks Migration Tool. The original main purpose of this tool was to help reduce the time and effort to migrate a configuration from one of the supported vendors to Palo Alto Networks.

By using the Migration Tool, everyone can convert a configuration from Checkpoint or Cisco or any other vendor to a PAN-OS and give you more time to improve the results. Migration Tool 3 added some functionalities to allow our customers to enforce security policies based on App-ID and User-ID as well.

With Expedition 1.X, we went one step further, not only because we want to continue helping to facilitate the transition of a security policy from others vendors to PAN-OS but we want to ensure the outcome makes use of the most advanced features of the platform to get you closer to the best of the possible configurations. For this reason, we added a Machine Learning module, which can help you to generate new security policies based on real log traffic, and we have introduced the Best Practices Assessment Tool, which checks whether the configuration complies with the Best Practices recommended by our security experts.

With Expedition 2.0, we had two main goals on mind:

- Improve the tool performance and reliability
- Provide automation features

With all these huge improvements, we expect the next time you use Expedition the journey to excellence will be easier.
